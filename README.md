# QuickAssist
# Description
- When I started the project I didn't have any clue what my app was going to be. The thing that was clear to me was that it had to have a social cause. I came up with the idea of an emergency app, USP being that it leverages the community that the app will build and make use of that community to help other people in need on the app.
In conclusion, the goal of "QuickAssist" is to provide an emergency app to the users so that they can find help whenever they are in need.
 
- "QuickAssist" is an android application that helps the user get essential help from nearby or from another quick assist volunteer. The user themselves can volunteer for others if they want to attend a distress call; The other feature "QuickAssist provides is the emergency contacts wherein the user can connect to the people as fast as possible; Emergency amenities is another interesting feature of the app where the user can choose what amenity they want and they would get all the places nearby their location that would help them reach the closest place possible(in progress).

- "QuickAssist" is an android application built on android studio with the help of Kotlin and some related libraries. The app uses Firebase as its backend to provide auth features in the app and to store the location of users in distress. All the data stored in Firebase is encrypted with unique hash keys. The maps used in the application are facilitated by google maps API.

- Although I had built a couple of apps in android, this one was new for me as I didn't have any knowledge of google maps API. The main problem was to implement a fragment and inflate it with the maps.

- The main improvement that I would make in this application would be implementing the places API. I tried implementing it in Emergency amenities but when 
I looked it up the API was asking for billing. Though it provides a $300 free credit it wasn't accepting my card and hence I could not use the API. That was the reason the emergency amenities take you into google maps instead of inflating the maps in the app itself. If I worked on it in the future this would be the first thing that I would take on.
